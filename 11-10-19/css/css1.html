         We have learned about an array in the previous section. C# also
        includes specialized classes that hold many values or objects 
        in a specific series, that are called 'collection'.

        There are two types of collections available in C#: non-generic
        collections and generic collections. We will learn about 
        non-generic collections in this section.
                    
        The System.Collections namespace includes the interfaces and
        classes for the non-generic collections. The following diagram
        illustrates the hierarchy of the interfaces and classes for the 
        non-generic collections.
